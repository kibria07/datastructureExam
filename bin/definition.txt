Data Structure Definition:


1) why do we need data structure?

answer: for the safety of data type. save time and for implicit casting of data type. reduce code redundancy.

2) List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
      website design, data reading,

3) what is an Array?
array is a datatpe which hole multiple value for a single variable .
4) what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
 array is a variable and arrayList is a data structure which implement List interface.

5) what is LinkedList?
   it is a data structure. it implements the list.

6) what is queue?
data structure. FIFO.

7) what is stack?
FILO

8) what is FIFO and LIFO?

9) what is the order of complexity?
is a branch of theory of computaton in theoritical computer science and mathematics. classifying the computational problem based on their inherent 
difficulty.

10)what is the best case to search an element from an array?
merge search

11)what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
linear search
12) what is tree in data structure?
tree is  a data structure with a value assigned to it.

13) what is graph in data structure?

14) what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?

15) What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS
Hierarchical data model


16) How HashMap works in java?
hashMap implements the map interface. it has a key and value.

17)What is Big-(O)-notation?

18)Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

19) Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of adding element.
  b)In terms of removing element.
  c)In terms of searching element.

   advantage                                                                 disadvantage
   list(can contain duplicate values)									           conflict
   set(do not allow duplication of data)
   array list(can pick value based on index)
   linkedlist()                                                               iterate through all element.
   merge sorting is faster than linear, bubble sort.
